            <p>I'm a solo developer passionate about creating meaningful digital experiences. This space serves as my personal corner of the web where I showcase my work and share my journey.</p>
            <p>I specialize in web development and enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn and grow. My focus is on creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly solutions.</p>
            <p>why is this so low tech?</p>
            <p>1. I wanted to build something different to how most programmers make theyre webpages</p>
            <p>2. I dont like web development / design, i see and respect its importance in the space but personally find it tedious, i perfer backend or cybersecurity</p>
            <p>But thanks to my polytechnic giving me a first semester webdesign class i now have this, i was taught more but i like simple straight forward</p>
